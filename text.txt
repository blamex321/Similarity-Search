Anna, do you get annoyed when your boyfriend flirts with someone else? If my boyfriend flirted with someone else, I would be quite upset, I think. But thankfully, my boyfriend's character is not like that. So, I don't think he would flirt with someone else. But if he did, I would get annoyed and probably angry and yell at him, maybe. So, what do you think is the limitation of the flirt? Like, what is okay and not okay? I think it depends on his intention. Like, if he's trying to get a girl's attention or kind of showing off for another girl, then I think it depends on his mind, kind of. But if he's just being friendly... His behavior. Yeah, his behavior is, I think, less important than his mind. Because if he's just being friendly and helping someone, then that's not a problem. But if he's like, hey, she's pretty, I want to get her attention, then that would make me annoyed. Yeah, but I think that's very subtle. Yeah, right. You don't really know what is true. That's true. So, how about you? What do you think is the limit? I think...
